**LangGraph手册**：[https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)

## 3.1 环境准备

```bash
pip install openai langgraph Agently==3.3.4.5 mermaid-python nest_asyncio
pip install langchain
pip install langchain-openai
pip install langchain-community
```

## 3.2 完整实现代码

```python
import json
import openai
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from openai import OpenAI
import os
